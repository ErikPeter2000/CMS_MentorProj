# Meeting Thu 07 March 
Erik

## Summary
 - Charles is pleased with the work done so far.
 - We will now progress to researching section 3 of the project: "A simple model of atmospheric convection".
 - Look into using Overleaf for our write-up and poster. Licencing is an issue.
 - Next meeting planned on Thursday 21 at 13.30.

## Comments on Progress
 - The equations described in Dexter's notes are less relevant to the motion of the atmosphere (but still useful to know).
 - The next sections will be easier to present as a poster.
 - Should revise why we can assume incompressibility: yes, it is related to sound but also the huge scale of the height we are working with. 
 - Overleaf licence may be bought by teachers, otherwise Charles can create a project and we can use our free accounts.

## Presentation Plans
 - [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) is a better choice for typing equations than Google Docs.
 - Overleaf also supports packages such as [Beamer Presentations](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Beamer_Presentations%3A_A_Tutorial_for_Beginners_(Part_1)%E2%80%94Getting_Started) for creating posters and [Tikz](https://tikz.dev/library-math).
 - Best to learn LaTeX as soon as possible.
