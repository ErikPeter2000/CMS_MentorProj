# Meeting Wed 07 Feb
Erik Hurinek

## Summary
 - Project is open-ended and designed to allow us to investigate "rabbit holes".
 - Currently aim to meet once a week until. Next meeting is Thursday 15 13.30 next week. This is subject to change.
 - There will be a presentation at the end.

## Project Structure and Deadlines
 - Project Aim: learn the basic principles and maths used in fluid dynamics.
 - 3 sections: "Fluid Dynamics", "A Simple Model of Atmospheric Convection", "Lorenz Model and Chaos Theory". (I'll see if I can get the PDF text on github).
 - Students will complete "Fluid Dynamics" and then decide if we want to split into smaller groups for the other two.
 - The first section will give us an idea of the difficulty of the project.
 - Students will plan to meet weekly with Charles to discuss progress (if there is any).
 - Aim to have something nearly finalised by end of April.
 - Stand-up presentation at the end, along with a written report of findings.
 - The report should be developed continuously throughout the following months.
 - Charles can give us specific problems if we want.
