## Summary
 - The Rayleigh-BÃ©nard equations are the navier stokes equations, but you assume mean or steady state. *What does this mean?*

## Next Time
 - Look into Lorenz Model.
 - Code a plotter for the Lorenz trajectory.
 - Read the ECMWF weather chaos theory paper.
 - Explain how weather evolves.
 - Answer the question "Why is it so difficult to predict the weather".
 - Understand how initial conditions affect the result.

## Presentation Plans
 - Use only necessary equations.
