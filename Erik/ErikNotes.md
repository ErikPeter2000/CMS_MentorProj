 - [Multivariable Chain Rule](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus/multivariable-derivatives/differentiating-vector-valued-functions/a/multivariable-chain-rule-simple-version)
 - Newtonian Fluids are fluids where stress is proportional to strain in all axis.
 - Isotropic: Same in all directions.
 - Toothpaste is an example of a non-Newtonian fluid.
 - Eulerian Perspective: Consider changes in fluid from a fixed point in space.
 - Lagrangian Perspective: Consider changes in fluid from a a moving particle.
 - Advection: The transfer of matter by flow.
