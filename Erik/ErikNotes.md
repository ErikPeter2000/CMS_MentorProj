 - [Multivariable Chain Rule](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus/multivariable-derivatives/differentiating-vector-valued-functions/a/multivariable-chain-rule-simple-version)
 - Newtonian Fluids are fluids where stress is proportional to strain in all axis.
 - Isotropic: Same in all directions.
 - Toothpaste is an example of a non-Newtonian fluid.
 - Eulerian Perspective: Consider changes in fluid from a fixed point in space.
 - Lagrangian Perspective: Consider changes in fluid from a a moving particle.
 - Advection: The transfer of matter by flow.
 - Material Derivative: The rate of change of a vector with respect to both time and its own components. Useful when you want to define how a fluid moves with respect to time and the overall gradient of fluid.
 $$\frac{Du}{Dt} = (\frac{d}{dt}+u\cdot \nabla) u$$
 - Navier Stokes Equation:
 $$\frac{Du}{Dt} = -\frac{1}{\rho}\nabla p + v \nabla^2u + F$$
 $$\nabla u = 0$$
 - $\frac{Du}{Dt}$: The material derivative of the movement of the fluid.
 - $-\frac{1}{\rho}\nabla p$: The negative pressure gradient.
 - $v\nabla^2u$: Something to do with diffusion and shear forces. *Maybe I copied it down wrong?*
 - $F$: Any external forces such as Weight.
