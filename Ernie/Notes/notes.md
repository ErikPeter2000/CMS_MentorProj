 - $$ F_{buoyant} = \rho g V_f$$

 - $$ Gr = \frac{\text{buoyant force}}{\text{viscous force}} = \frac{g  \Delta\rho V}{\rho \nu^{2}} = \frac{g \beta \Delta T  V}{\nu^{2}}$$
 - $$ \beta  = \text{the reciprocal of mean temperature } (K^{-1})$$
 - $$ \rho = \text{density at mean temperature}$$
 - $$ g = \text{gravitational constant } (m s^{-2})$$
 - $$ \Delta T = \text{temperature difference } (K)$$
 - $$ \nu = \text{kinematic viscosity of the fluid} (m^{2} s^{-1})$$

 - $$ \text{In terms of viscosity Grashof number can be defined as }  \frac{\bar \rho g B^{3} \Delta \rho}{\mu ^ {2}}$$
 - It is a dimensionless quantity
 - $$ \Delta \rho = \text{total change in density between regions of high and low temperature}$$

 - When Gr >> 1 the viscous force is negligible compared to the buoyancy and inertial forces
 - When buoyant forces overcome the viscous forces the flow starts to transition to the turbulent regime
