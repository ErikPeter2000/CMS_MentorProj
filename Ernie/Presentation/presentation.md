Layout of day:
 - 4 conference rooms in the divinity school for verbal presentations
 - Downstairs poster presentations
 - Go into room with 2/3 other groups give a verbal presentation to the other groups and guests (parents, mentors)
 - Verbal presentation 10 mins
 - Downstairs big board with a poster presentation
 - People will be walking around looking at the posters and we need to answer questions that they ask
 - Basic structure in poster presentation and verbal should/will be similar 


Good for visual:
 - Diagrams (with nice colours)
 - Not too text heavy
 - Equations (would need to explain them / maybe add derivations but take up a lot of room)
 - Methods used to calculate something/ methods for research
 - Layout (portrait or landscape)
 - Sign posting
 - Key headings (different sections of the brief)
 - e.g split into chaos theory and fluid dynamics
 - Think of what is more interesting for an audience
 - References

Good for verbal:
 - Not a lot of text on powerpoint
 - Relates to common sense stuff...
 - Don't overcomplicate it
 - Go over the process relating to a concept
 - Why we picked the project
 - Challenges with presenting/learning
 - How we went about solving a problem
 - Why we need the things we researched (kind of obvious for the weather though)
 - What are we trying to answer what is the aim of what we are doing
 - Introduction
 - Draw conclusions (what have we found)
 - References
